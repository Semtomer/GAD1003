The details of the given project are as follows:    
There is a casino game with 2 games.

The first game is Dice game. In the game, the computer and the player roll 2 dice each. The one who rolls the highest dice wins the game. The player bets each round, if the player wins the round, he/she wins double his bet.

The second game is the Guess game. In the game the computer keeps a random number from 0 to 1000. The player tries to guess that number by placing a bet. Each round, the minimum bet is increased. If the number is guessed, a big win is made.
